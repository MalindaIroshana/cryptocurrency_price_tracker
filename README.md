# cryptocurrency_price_tracker
Node.js RESTful API using CoinGecko public API, Express.js, and MongoDB. Get real-time and historical crypto prices for seamless integration.

## Develop a REST API for Cryptocurrency Price Tracking with User Authentication

01) Objective :

Build a RESTful API using JavaScript that retrieves cryptocurrency prices from an external API, updates at regular intervals and includes user authentication.

02) Key Requirements:

a) API Integration:

   - Integrate with a public cryptocurrency price API (like CoinGecko, CoinAPI, or CryptoCompare).
   - Retrieve prices for a set of predefined cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple).

b) CRUD Operations:

   - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing a list of user's favorite cryptocurrencies.
   - Store user data in a suitable database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL).

c) Real-Time Updates:

   - Set up the API to refresh cryptocurrency prices every 5 minutes.
   - If possible, implement real-time price updates using WebSockets or a similar technology.

d) User Authentication:

   - Implement user registration and login functionality.
   - Secure user data and authenticate API requests.
   - Consider using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for maintaining user sessions.

e) Documentation & Testing:

   - Provide thorough API documentation (consider using tools like Swagger).
   - Include unit and integration tests to ensure API reliability.

f) Bonus (Optional):

   - Add functionality for users to set alerts for price changes.
   - Implement a basic frontend to interact with the API.

03) Deliverables:

 - Source code repository (e.g., GitHub).
 - API documentation.
 - Test suite and results.
 - A brief report explaining your choices in API design, libraries used, and any challenges faced during development.

04) Evaluation Criteria:

- Code quality and clarity.
- Adherence to RESTful principles.
- Security best practices in user authentication.
- Effective use of asynchronous programming.
- Robust error handling.
- Comprehensive documentation and testing.
